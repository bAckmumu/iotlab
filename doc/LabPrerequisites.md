<!-- /MDTOC -->

## Prerequisites
In order to participate in the Lab, you need a computer running the **Arduino-IDE** as well as an **USB driver** for the **ESP8266** prototyping board (aka NodeMCU).

  * [Installation instructions Linux](ArduinoIDE_Linux.md)
  * [Installation instructions Windows and Mac OS X](ArduinoIDE_Windows.md)
  * All platforms: [Configuration of the Arduino-IDE](ArduinoIDE_ESP8266_configuration.md) for use with the ESP8266

**Since we have a tight timeline in the lab, please prepare your computer before the lab starts. We will not have time during the lab to perform the above noted steps.**

## Let's start
If you have finished the installation and configuration of the Arduino-IDE as described above, [you are ready to start with our first sketch, the embedded version of "hello, world!"](HelloWorld.md).
