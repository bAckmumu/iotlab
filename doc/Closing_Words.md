## IoT-Lab: Closing words

Congratulations, you successfully made it through the IoT-Lab!

This lab aimed to provide basic knowledge on the device related side of the Internet of Things, we touched the following topics:
  * Micro controllers
  * MQTT and the concept of lose coupling
  * Embedded development

Though we quickly built a device with decent functionality, keep in mind, that this the implementation is not ready for productive use. In a real world application we certainly need tackle with the following aspects:
  * Encryption (data in transit/data at rest)
  * Authentication and authorization
  * Device personalization process
  * Power management
  * Tamper protection
  * UX considerations (e.g. there is no display)

**Thanks for participating.**
